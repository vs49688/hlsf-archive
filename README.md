# Half-Life: Static-Friction Source Code

This a dump of the old Half-Life: Static-Friction source tree.
This is horrid code from many, many years ago. Please don't judge
too harshly.

* HL:SF is built upon SoHL 1.8, see the `SpiritSource18` folder.
* The map sources are contained within `RMF/`
  - Most of the maps were created by `hlife_hotdog`.
